Update 4:

Update to AlyxLib v1.3.0

Update 3:

Update to new AlyxLib standards.

Update 2:

This addon has been completely overhauled to use the new AlyxLib scripting system. It requires the AlyxLib addon to be downloaded and enabled.

Fixed weird grab pose that sometimes occurred when taking glasses off face (hopefully).

Fixed "invalid storage" message that sometimes appeared when putting glasses on.

Added console variable to change blur amount, no longer dependent on difficulty.

Added console variables for drop chances, no longer dependent on difficulty.

Added console variables for dropped glasses hints.


The transition to the new AlyxLib API is a complex update so please bear with me during this time. I do this as a hobby and cannot always dedicate my time to fixes.

Update 1:

Amount of vision blur is based on difficulty.
